I use Visual Studio Code recently as my main editor replacing Atom. Since 0.10, Visual Studio Code supports extension (package in Atom/Sublime). By default, Visual Studio Code has embedded useful extensions such as Git and Emmet. I found other useful extensions to improve my productivity. Here they are:

### [Editor Config](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/chrisdias.vscodeEditorConfig)

[Editor Config](http://editorconfig.org/) support for Visual Studio code. Very useful if you use editor config in your project.

### [Dash](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/deerawan.vscode-dash)

This extension integrates [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) documentation in Visual Studio Code. You can search text in specific documentation or all documentation. It will open the Dash and show the results based on the selected text.

### [ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

An extension to integrate [ES Lint](http://eslint.org/), one of the best javascript linter, to Visual Studio Code.

### [Travis CI Status](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/felixrieseberg.vsc-travis-ci-status)

Very handy to see Travis CI Status directly in Visual Studio Code. I have some repositories that I manage which I found useful to see its travis CI status immediately.

### [Angular 1 Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/johnpapa.Angular1)

Made by John Papa to match his angular style guide. It contains many useful snippets such as controller, service and directive.
