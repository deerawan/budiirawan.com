React provides two built-in hooks with similar names but distinct behaviors: `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`. While they share some similarities, their execution timing and use cases differ significantly.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // content
}, []);

useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // content
}, []);
```

Take a look at this hook flow diagram below to know when the hooks are called.

`useEffect`

- Runs **after** the browser paints the screen
- Runs **asynchronously**

`useLayoutEffect`

- Runs **before** the browser paints the screen
- Runs **synchronously**

The `useEffect` is useful for doing things that don't need to happen right away due to its asynchronous nature. For example, you can use it to fetch data from the server, log something to the console, or send an analytics event.

```tsx
const DataFetchingComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return <div>{/* Render data */}</div>;
};
```

The `useLayoutEffect` hook is ideal for making immediate visual changes or performing DOM measurements before the browser paints. It's particularly useful for tasks like measuring element dimensions, adjusting element positions, or scrolling to specific locations. Additionally, if you notice flickering in your UI, switching from `useEffect` to `useLayoutEffect` can often resolve the issue by ensuring changes are applied synchronously before the screen updates.

```tsx
const ScrollToTopComponent = () => {
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  }, []);

  return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>;
};
```

# Summary

In this article, we explored the key differences between React's `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks:

1. **Execution Timing**:

   - `useEffect` runs after the browser paints the screen.
   - `useLayoutEffect` runs before the browser paints the screen.

2. **Synchronicity**:

   - `useEffect` is asynchronous.
   - `useLayoutEffect` is synchronous.

3. **Use Cases**:

   - `useEffect` is ideal for non-urgent tasks like data fetching, logging, or analytics.
   - `useLayoutEffect` is best for immediate visual changes, DOM measurements, or fixing UI flickering issues.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - `useEffect` is generally preferred for better performance in most scenarios.
   - `useLayoutEffect` should be used sparingly, only when synchronous updates are necessary.

Understanding these differences helps in choosing the right hook for specific scenarios, optimizing React component behavior and performance.
