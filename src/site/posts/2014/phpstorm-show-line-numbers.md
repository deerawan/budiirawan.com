If you install PHPStorm, you will notice that the default setting of this editor doesn't show line numbers. For me, it is important to show this. Here is how to activate it.

_Note: I'm using mac and PHP Storm 8.0.3_

1. Go to **Preferences**
2. Go to **Editor** -> **General** \-> **Appeareance**
3. Click to check on **Show line numbers**
4. Done :)
